# MyReads Project

This is the project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course of Frontend Nanodegree.

## What this project is about:

The main page shows 3 shelves for books:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

There is an arrow control for each book, which gives the opportunity to the user to move the book from one
shelf to another one or remove it from the shelves.

There is also a plus button, which leads the user to the search page. The user can add new books to his shelves from this page.

The backend API used for search uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.


## To get the app running:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
